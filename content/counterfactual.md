Counterfactual reasoning is *reasoning about data that we did not observe*. For
example, reasoning about the expected reward of new policy given data collected
from a older one.

In this post, I'll discuss some basic techniques for learning from logged
data. For the large part, this post is based on things I learned from
[Bottou et al. (2013)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2355) (one my favorite
papers!).

**Setup**: We're trying to optimize a function of the form,

$$
J(\theta) = \underset{p_\theta}{\mathbb{E}} \left[ r(x) \right] = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p_\theta(x) r(x).
$$

<br/> But! We only have a *fixed* sample of size $m$ from a data collection
policy $q$, $\{ (r^{(j)}, x^{(j)} ) \}_{j=1}^m \overset{\text{i.i.d.}} \sim q.$

I've used the notation $r^{(j)}$ instead of $r(x^{(j)})$ to emphasize that we
can't evaluate $r$ at $x$ values other than those in the sample. This setup is
sometimes called *off-line off-policy optimization*.

Technicalities: To avoid difficulties, we'll assume that $q$ assigns positive
probability everywhere, $q(x) > 0$ for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$ (assumption
A1). This means is that the data collection process must be randomized and
eventually sample all possible configurations. Later, I discuss relaxing this
assumption (see 'extensions').

In many domains, there are inevitably components of $q$ and $p_{\theta}$ that
are only accessible via sampling. For example, a *contextual bandit problem*,
where $x$ is a context-action pair, $x = (s,a)$. Here $q$ is factored as $q(x) =
q(s,a) = q(a|s) p(s)$ and $p_{\theta}$ is factored as $p_{\theta}(x) =
p_{\theta}(s,a) = p_{\theta}(a|s) p(s)$. Note that $p$ and $q$ share a factor
$p(s)$, the distribution over contexts. So they only differ in the the
distribution of over actions given context. We discuss this further in 'unknown
factors'.

<!--
(We can
even extend it to a full-blown MDP or POMDP by taking $x$ to be a sequence of
state-action pairs, often called "trajectories".)
-->

The main challenge of this setting is that we don't have controlled experiments
to learn from because $q$ is not (completely) in our control. This manifests
itself as high variance ("noise") in estimating $J(\theta)$. Consider the
contextual bandit setting, here we sample a state and get to try a single
action; we never get to rollback to that precise state and try an alternative
action (#yolo) because we do not control $p(s)$. This is an important paradigm
for many 'real world' problems, e.g., predicting medical treatments or ad
selection.

<!--
This is the crucial difference that makes counterfactual learning
more difficult than (fully) supervised learning.
-->

**Estimating $J(\theta)$** [V1]: We obtain an unbiased estimator of $J(\theta)$
with
[importance sampling](http://timvieira.github.io/blog/post/2014/12/21/importance-sampling/),

$$
J(\theta)
\approx \hat{J}_{\!\text{IS}}(\theta)
= \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^m r^{(j)} \!\cdot\! w^{(j)}_{\theta}
\quad \text{ where } w^{(j)}_{\theta} = \frac{p_{\theta}(x^{(j)}) }{ q(x^{(j)}) }.
$$

<br/> This estimator is remarkable: it uses importance sampling as a function
approximator! We have an *unbiased* estimate of $J(\theta)$ for any value of
$\theta$ that we like. *The catch* is that we have to pick $\theta$ a priori,
i.e., with no knowledge of the sample. We also require that the usual 'support
conditions' for importance sampling conditions ($p_{\theta}(x)>0 \Rightarrow
q(x)>0$ for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$, which is why we made assumption A1.

After we've collected a (large) sample it's possible to optimize
$\hat{J}_{\!\text{IS}}$ using any (deterministic) optimization algorithm (e.g.,
L-BFGS). Of course, we risk overfitting to the sample if we evaluate
$\hat{J}_{\!\text{IS}}$. Actually, it's a bit worse: this objective tends to
favor regions of $\theta$, which are not well represented in the sample because
the importance sampling estimator has high variance in these regions resulting
from large importance weights (when $q(x)$ is small and $p_{\theta}(x)$ is
large, $w(x)$ is large and consequently so is $J_{\text{IS}}$ regardless of
whether $r(x)$ is high!). Thus, we want some type of "regularization" to keep
the optimizer in regions which are sufficiently well-represented by the sample.

<!--
**Visual example**: We can visualize this phenomena in a simple example. Let $q
= \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma=5)$, $r(x) = 1 \text{ if } x \in [2, 3], 0.2 \text{
otherwise},$ and $p_\theta = \mathcal{N}(\theta, \sigma=1)$.  This example is
nice because it let's us plot $x$ and $\theta$ in the same space. This is
generally not the case, because $\mathcal{X}$ may have no connection to $\theta$
space, e.g., $\mathcal{X}$ may be discrete.

**TODO** add plot
-->

**Better surrogate** [V2]: There are many ways to improve the variance of the
estimator and *confidently* obtain improvements to the system. One of my
favorites is Bottou et al.'s lower bound on $J(\theta)$, which we get by
clipping importance weights, replace $w^{(j)}_{\theta}$ with $\min(R,
w^{(j)}_{\theta})$.

**Confidence intervals** [V3]: We can augment the V2 lower bound with confidence
intervals derived from the empirical Bernstein bound (EBB). The EBB *penalizes*
hypotheses (values of $\theta$) which have higher sample variance. (Note: a
Hoeffding bound wouldn't change the *shape* of the objective, but EBB does
thanks to the sample variance penalty. EBB tends to be tighter.). The EBB
introduces an additional a "confidence" hyperparameter, $(1-\delta)$. Bottou et
al. recommend maximizing the lower bound as it provides safer improvements. See
the original paper for the derivation.

<!--
An important benefit of having upper *and* lower is that the bounds tell
us whether or not we should collect more data
-->

Both V2 and V3 are *biased* (as they are lower bounds), but we can mitigate the
bias by *tuning* the hyperparameter $R$ on a heldout sample (we can even tune
$\delta$, if desired). Additionally, V2 and V3 are 'valid' when $q$ has limited
support since they prevent the importance weights from exploding (of course, the
bias can be arbitrarily bad, but unavoidable given the learning-from-only-logged
data setup).

Extensions
----------

<!--
**Be warned**: This may be considered an idealized setting. Much of the research
in counterfactual and causal reasoning targets (often subtle) deviations from
these assumptions (and some different questions, of course). Some extensions and
discussion appear towards the end of the post.
-->

**Unknown factors**: Consider the contextual bandit setting (mentioned
above). Here $p$ and $q$ share an *unknown* factor: the distribution of
contexts. Luckily, we do not need to know the value of this factor in order to
apply any of our estimators because they are all based on likelihood *ratios*,
thus the shared unknown factors in the importance weights cancel out! Some
specific examples are given below. Of course, these factors do influence the
estimators because they are crucial in *sampling*, they just aren't necessary in
*evaluation*.

  - In contextual bandit example, $x$ is a state-action pair, $w_{\theta}(x) =
    \frac{p_{\theta}(x)}{q(x)} = \frac{ p_{\theta}(s,a) }{ q(s,a) } =
    \frac{p_{\theta}(a|s) p(s)}{q(a|s) p(s)} = \frac{p_{\theta}(a|s) }{ q(a|s)
    }$.

  - In a Markov decision process, $x$ is a sequence of state-action pairs,
    $w_{\theta}(x) = \frac{p_{\theta}(x)}{q(x)} = \frac{ p(s_0) \prod_{t=0}^T
    p(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t) p_\theta(a_t|s_t) } { p(s_0) \prod_{t=0}^T
    p(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t) q(a_t|s_t) } = \frac{\prod_{t=0}^T \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}
    {\prod_{t=0}^T q(a_t|s_t)}.$

**Variance reduction**: Mostly rely on
[control variates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_variates) of which
*baseline functions* are a special case. These other variables (covariates) that
are correlated with $r(x)$ for which we know their expectations (or at least
they are estimated separately). A great example is how ad click depend strongly
on time-of-day (fewer people are online late at night so we get fewer clicks),
thus the time-of-day covariate explains a large part of the variation in $r(x)$.

**Unknown $q$**: Often $q$ is an existing complex system, which does not record
its probabilities. It is possible to use regression to estimate $q$ from the
samples, which is called the **propensity score** (PS). Unfortunately, PS
results in a biased estimator because we're using a 'ratio of expectations'
instead of an 'expectation of ratios'. PS is only statistically consistent in
the (unlikely) event that the density estimate is correctly specified. In the
unknown $q$ setting, it's better to use the **doubly-robust estimator** (DR)
which combines *two* estimators: a density estimator for $q$ and a function
approximation for $r$. A great explanation for the bandit case is in
[Dud√≠k et al. (2011)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.4601). The DR estimator is also
biased, but it has a better bias-variance tradeoff than PS.

**What if $q$ doesn't have support everywhere?** This is an especially important
setting because it is often the case that data collection policies abide by some
**safety regulations**, which prevent bad configurations. In many situations,
evaluating $r(x)$ corresponds to execution a policy ($q$) in the real world and
as terrible outcomes could occur, such as, breaking a system, giving a patient a
bad treatment, or losing money. V1 is ok to use as long as we satisfy the
importance sampling support conditions, which might mean rejecting certain
values for $\theta$ and consequently finding a less-optimal policy (this might
be non-trivial to enforce). V2 and V3 are ok to use without an explicit
constraint, but additional care may be needed to ensure specific safety
constraints are satisfied (if that's desired).

**What if $q$ is deterministic?** This is related to the point above. This is a
really hard problem. Essentially, this trying to learn without any exploration /
experimentation! In general, we need exploration to learn. Randomization isn't
the only way to perform exploration, there are many systematic types of
experimentation. It's however, more difficult to account for **confounding
variables**, which are hidden causes that control variation in the data. Failing
to account for confounding variables may lead to
[incorrect conclusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_paradox).

  - There are some cases of systematic (non-random) exploration /
    experimentation that are ok. For example, enumerating all elements of
    $\mathcal{X}$ (almost certainly infeasible). Another example is a contextual
    bandit where $q$ assigns actions to contexts deterministically via a hash
    function. This setting is fine because $q$ is essentially a uniform
    distribution over actions, which is independent of the state. In other
    special cases, we may be able to characterize systematic exploration as
    *stratified sampling*.

  - A generic solution might be to apply the doubly-robust estimator, which
    "smooths out" deterministic components (by pretending they are random) and
    accounting for confounds (by explicitly modeling them in the inverse
    propensity estimate, which often requires careful domain knowledge).

**What if we control data collection ($q$)?** This is an interesting
setting. Essentially, it asks "how do we explore/experiment optimally (and
safely)?". In general, this is an open question and depends on many
considerations, such as, how much control, exploration cost (safety constraints)
and prior knowledge (of $r$ and unknown factors in the environment). I've seen
some papers cleverly design $q$. The first that comes to mind is
[Levine & Koltun (2013)](https://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/gpspaper/gps_full.pdf). Another
setting is *online* contextual bandits, in which algorithms like
[EXP4](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v15/beygelzimer11a/beygelzimer11a.pdf)
and Thompson sampling, prescribe certain types of exploration. Lastly, I'll
mention that there is a fair amount of work in choosing importance sampling
proposal distributions to reduce variance, which may apply.
